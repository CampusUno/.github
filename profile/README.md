## Hi there 👋

**This is [Campus One](https://campusone.live/)!** What is CampusOne you ask? <br><br>
CampusOne is a virtual platform for the students of **Galgotias College** but more than that, this is an effort towards building a vibrant community of forward thinkers by recognizing talent, boosting collaboration and generating true college culture.
<br><br>
And I want your help to make this project successful! How? <br>
* Following this organization
* Starring this and all future repositories
* Finding out issues and making feature requests
* Actively contributing to issues and adding on to the software
<br>
The website is expected to launch on 3rd of December and I want you to take full advantage of it by checking in, posting regularly and most importantly spreading the word. <br>
See you there.
